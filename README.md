# Tower Defense Game - NEA-Code
For Jack Maguire's 2019-2020 A-Level Computer Science
Managed to get me an A*.

Coded in Java, using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition.
Make sure to use Java 14 - some features won't work otherwise.

Just run the java code using javac/java, no libraries needed.


Main Class is at JackMaguireNEA/src/main/ApexTurrets.java


Turn down volume, as it can be quite loud when it boots up.
